# Social Augmentation

This small script was made to print stat values for significanties.

## Explanation
There was a dataset with answers to a questionnaire regarding three headsets
(the Connector, the rotator and the protector). The answers were analysed using
this simple Python script to find significancies.
It was first made in SPSS, but incorrectly added some answers that should have
been removed, the first dataset was checked with this script and then the
answers were removed and the stats recalculated.
